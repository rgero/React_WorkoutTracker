# React Workout Tracker
-----

This is going to be a small application that can be used to track a person's workout. Currently it is set up for lifting, but it might be smart to change it so it also works for Cardio Exercises, also combining them, and also for classes.

I currently need to explore that React Bootstrap Forms for a little styling help. That will be the next thing that I do for this project.

Things to do:
    - Finish getting this under test using the lessons learned through the React Testing Course.
    - Create a Docker File for this
    - Deploy to AWS?
    

Issues
    - Currently the Workout List doesn't delete workouts.
    - Creating a new workout doesn't redirect to the Dashboard
    - You can't change the display order on the workout list (it's currently ascending which is the worst)
    - Edit doesn't work.
    - There's no link back to Dashboard when you are viewing a workout
    - The View Workout kind of sucks
    - There is no Stats Page
    - There's no way to export the data (nice to have)
    - There's no way to import the data (nice to have)
