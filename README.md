# React Workout Tracker
-----

This is going to be a small application that can be used to track a person's workout. Currently it is set up for lifting, but it might be smart to change it so it also works for Cardio Exercises, also combining them, and also for classes.

I currently need to explore that React Bootstrap Forms for a little styling help. That will be the next thing that I do for this project.

Currently the basic API works.
