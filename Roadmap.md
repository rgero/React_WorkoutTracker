Roadmap - Brainstorming on Apr 24, 2023
--------------------------
Current Plan
    - Get the existing functionality under test
        - Let's start with the smallest components and grow out
            - Sets
                - Set Form
                - Set List
            - Exercises
                - Exercise Form
                - Exericse List
                    - Exercise List Item
            - Workouts
                - Workout Form
                - Workout Group
                - Workout List
                    - List Item
                - Add Workout Page
                - Edit Workout Page
                - View Workout Detail Page
                - View Workouts Page
    - The View Workout Page revamp
        - I am going to need a way to sort the exercises by a criteria
            - Name
            - Muscle Group
            - Weights (?)
        - Do I want have the option for them to be grouped by Muscle Group?
    - Ability to search through the data
        - Search by Date
        - Search by Exercise Name
        - Search by Muscle Group (?)
    - Stats Page
        - What would I want to be here?
    - Importing the Data
        - What would this look like?

Thoughts Behind this
    - I definitely want to get the items under test, and this shouldn't take more than a week given my schedule. This will make it so I can refactor stuff or change the design if I want to.
